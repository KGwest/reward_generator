# Reward Generator

A playful, interactive app that celebrates self-care through random rewards and colorful animations.

## Overview

Reward Generator is a lightweight, browser-based tool designed to offer a moment of delight. Each click reveals a randomly assigned self-care reward and celebrates the moment with animated confetti. Originally developed during a Summer 2025 internship, this app demonstrates how small interactions can spark joy and create positive reinforcement loops.
